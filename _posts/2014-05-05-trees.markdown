The beauty of plants has attracted the attention of mathematics for centuries. A question arose one day about how a tree would be drawn programagically. My first though was that it would be a recursive algorithm of drawing branches and child branches. This solution works but it offers complexity and is not general enough for re-use in similar applications. However, when i found this [site][algorithmic botany], I was introduced to a whole new approach, the Lindenmayer System. The central concept of L-systems is that of rewriting. In general, rewriting is a technique for defining complex objects by successively replacing parts of a single initial object using a set of rewriting rules of productions.
    
After reading more into this, I decided I want to apply these concepts to a project. I decided I wanted this to be available on the web. In this way people would be able to learn about coding for an L-systems and experiment with their own designs. But, first I had to [learn][udacity] [three.js]. Learning about three.js was fun too, but this is another story for another project in my head. After a few iterations, the prototype is now [done][tree].
